# Analyzing Young Adults’ Choice of Behaviour Based on Their Environment

In this project we have tried to analyze how a young adult's choice of behaviour might be influenced by the type of neighborhood they lived in, and their equations and bonding with friends and family.

## About the dataset
This analysis is based on a survey conducted by Inter University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) 34658. This survey was mostly targeted to know about a person, their friends, what school they studied in, what do they do in their free time and what problems they might have faced, for eg: bullying, trauma etc. This is a data documentation consisting of 70 questions. Unfortunately the data source can't be provided since this is a college project. But the visualizations and analysis done through them have been shared.

## Tools Used
Tableau and Python matplotlib was used in this project

## Motivation
We want to visually analyze the factors that influence a young adult’s choice of actions toward committing criminal activities like theft and drug usage.
For our project, the factors considered are:
- Family
- Neighborhood Ambience
- Friends and Peers
